# Configurator
Prototype configuration tool

# Developers
Developer tools:
- Visual Studio Code 
- Podman for devcontainer development

Notes:
- Upon first load of the C# Dev Kit extension click *Upgrade* when vscode requests to upgrade the C# extension to the pre-release version. I have not found a way yet to do this automatically during or post container build.
